<#
    This scripts creates the resource. 
    The provider does not add any additional parameters to this resource other than what you specify in the "create" attribute.
    The create script is expected to return the full JSON object with "id" and "resource"

    This example is simple: we simply read the target state, construct the JSON in the format the provider expects
    and save the JSON into a file. The "read" script is then able to pick up the file.

    You can change the file to be any external resource on the cloud or whatever you need
    that has no official provider in the terraform registry.

                               # terraform can actually pick it up and show in a plan
